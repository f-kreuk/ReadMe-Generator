 ## Description
 
 The ReadMe-Generator streamlines the process of generating standardized, quality ReadMe files for projects. Quality ReadMe files enable users to learn what installations are necessary to run the project, how to utilize the application, what license governs usage of the application, as well as how to contribute or ask questions. Programmers prefer to spend time programming, rather than writing a ReadMe for their projects. This application saves programmers the time and hassle of building ReadMe files and enables them to spend time doing what they prefer!

 ## Installation
 
 To utilize this project, ensure you have installed Node.js version [18.17.0 LTS](nodejs.org/en). In addition, ensure you have installed inquirer version 8.2.4 by cloning the repository and running “npm install inquirer@8.2.4” in your integrated terminal.
 
 ## Usage
 
 After completing the installation process, you are ready to utilize the application. To utilize the application, simply open your index.js file in an integrated terminal and run the command: “node index.js”. Then answer the questions prompted. When you have answered all the questions, you will receive a success prompt, and a README.md file will be generated based on the input values. Note: For purposes of the UCONN coding bootcamp, a credits section is included with links to tutorials and videos utilized in producing this project. In addition, four screenshots and a video are hardcoded into the Usage section. These links would need to be removed from the index.js file if utilized by someone else.
 
See below a screenshot of the prompts in action:
